# 💰 Finance Dashboard Backend

## 📌 Overview

The Finance Dashboard Backend is a RESTful API built using Java and Spring Boot that enables users to manage financial records and access summarized insights through a secure, role-based system.

The system supports multiple user roles with controlled access to financial data and provides analytical endpoints for dashboard-level reporting such as income, expenses, and trends.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patidarshivani/finance-dashboard.git
cd finance-dashboard
```

---

### 2. Configure Database

Update `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/finance_db
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

---

### 3. Run Application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

---
## 🔑 Default Admin Credentials

To ensure the system is usable immediately after startup, a default admin user is automatically created when the application runs for the first time.

### 📧 Admin Login Details:

* **Email:** [admin@gmail.com](mailto:admin@gmail.com)
* **Password:** admin123

### 📝 Note:

* This admin user is initialized using a startup configuration class (`DataInitializer`).
* If the admin already exists in the database, it will not be created again.
* Use these credentials to access protected APIs and create/manage users and financial records.

### ⚠️ Important:

* All user management and record creation APIs require **Admin access**.
* Please use the above credentials in API testing tools like Postman (Basic Auth).

### 4. Test APIs

Use tools like Postman for API testing.
